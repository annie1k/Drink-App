**Why this application**:

I choose this theme because I often forget to drink water 
until I feel too thirsty. The main reason is my mom did a surgery
for the kidney stone in HongKong. That surgery made her suffering
from weakness for more than a month. Therefore, I want to design a water
drinking reminder application for people like her to keep her kidney healthier.
The application will have clean interface and no ads. for better user
experience.
